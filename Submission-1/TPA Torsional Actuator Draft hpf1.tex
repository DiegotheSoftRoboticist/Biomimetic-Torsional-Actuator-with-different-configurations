\begin{abstract}
Artificial muscle systems have the potential to impact many technologies ranging from advanced prosthesis to miniature robotics. Recently, it has been shown that twisting drawn polymer monofilaments, such as nylon fishing line or sewing thread, can result in a biomimetic thermally activated torsional actuator. The actuation phenomenon in these twisted polymer actuators (TPAs) is thought to be a result of an untwisting that occurs about the fiber's axis due to an asymmetric thermal expansion. Before being twisted, the precursor fibers are comprised of polymer chains that are aligned axially. During fabrication of TPAs, the polymer chains reorient as the precursor fiber is twisted about the central axis of the monofilament.  At the end of the fabrication process, the TPA is annealed in order to relieve internal stresses and to keep the fiber in the twisted configuration. Upon heating the (untwisted) precursor fiber, it expands radially and contracts axially. After being twist, these radial and axial expansion relationships remain relatively unchanged, but the polymer chain direction is no longer axially aligned. Thus, upon heating the twisted fibers of the TPA, the fibers untwist and torsional actuation occurs.  This result is similar to the effect one would expect when inflating a cylindrical balloon that has been helically wrapped with an inextensible string. As the balloon inflates, the string (i.e. the polymer chain) cannot stretch, so it must untwist on the balloon as the helical circumference it is wrapped around increases. 

Compared to other torsional actuators TPAs are low cost, lightweight, and can actuate reasonably high torques per unit volume.  However, because TPAs are thermally activated, they may not be suitable for all applications. 

In this work, we present a novel TPA design for use as a torsional actuator for miniature actuation and artificial muscle applications. Our design bundles twisted monofilaments to increase the torque. Both fabrication and testing methods of the new design are presented.  Results for temperature versus torsional displacement under various loads give insights as to how these actuators may be used and the reversibility of the actuation process.  

%with heating wire to supply the temperature change and induce actuation. The conceptual design of this novel torsional actuator is presented here, along with the unloaded free rotation response of various configurations. Experimental characterization of the design includes direct temperature measurements of the TPA using an attached thermocouple, and  torsional displacement measured using video recordings of the actuation.  Results of these tests are presented and comparisons are made between the various configurations. Based on these results, we suggest further improvements that could be made to the design of these torsional actuators.  \end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
%The apparent simplicity of drawn polymer monofilaments has until recently hidden their capacity for work as an actuator. 
It was recently shown that drawn polymers monofilament such as nylon fishing line have the ability to act as linear actuators when twisted and configured helically if exposed to temperature changes \cite{haines_artificial}. The same monofilaments can be torsional actuators if twisted but not coiled heliccally \cite{haines_artificial}.  In the pursuit of an thermo-mechanical actuation model for these twisted polymer systems, our group has looked toward understanding how twisted polymer monofilaments would react torsionally when exposed to temperature changes \cite{shafer_first}. As part of this modeling effort, concepts in torsional actuation configurations were conceived. This work presents conceptual designs and actuation performance for a torsional actuator based on two configurations of a twisted polymer actuator (TPA). 

Twisted polymer actuators, when configured to act as a linear actuator, are often classified as a type of artificial muscle. A wide variety of artificial muscle technologies exist for linear actuation. While less work has focused on how smart materials can be configured for torsional actuation, there are still a number of materials in use. Some of these technologies use a linear actuation phenomenon in a helical configuration to induce a twisting. Nitinol shape memory alloys (SMA), typically used for linear actuation, have been used in a tube configuration to create a torsional actuator [3***]. Many other torsional actuation technologies rely on  radial changes of materials in helical configurations. Electroactive polymers, pneumatic and hydraulic artificial muscles, and carbon nanotubes, have all been used in a helical configuration to create torsional actuation through radial changes [1, 2, 5, 6]. While the method of radial changes varies between materials, the mechanism of actuation remains the same and relies on increasing the path length for helically wrapped fibers. Each of these technologies has impressive performance in at least one metric, but none are as simple and inexpensive as torsional twisted polymer actuators.

In discussing these polymer actuators, it is important to make clear the differences in terminology regarding `twist' and `coil'. A precursor fiber is considered to be a straight drawn polymer fiber, such as monofilament fishing line, while a twisted fiber is one in which a precursor fiber is twisted about its central axis but remains straight. Although a twisted precursor fiber will remain straight, after twisting its polymer chains will be helically oriented about the precursor fiber?s axis with a pitch angle that depends in radial position. Figure \ref{fig:helix} highlights how twisting reorients the polymer chains into a helical configuration with a radially dependent pitch. Typically, after twisting the material is annealed so that internal stresses are relieved and the material remains twisted when unloaded. Coiling refers to a fiber, twisted or untwisted, that is annealed in a helical configuration. This helical configuration can be developed by increasing the amount of twist in a precursor fiber to a point at which the fiber torsionally buckles and coils over on itself, or helically wrapping on a mandrel. With these definitions for `twisting' and `coiling,' we use the terms ?straight-twisted polymer actuators? (STPA) to refer to the torsional actuators that are not coiled, and `twisted-coiled polymer actuators' (TCPA) to refer the linear actuators in the helical configuration. 

Individual straight twisted polymer actuators can be used to generate low torque torsional actuations similar to the way in which CNT yarns have been used in the past [1***]. In this work, we present isotonic torsional actuation performance for such a monofilament STPA configuration. We also consider here the configuration of STPAs wrapped into a parallel configuration such that multiple STPAs work together to generate a torque. This configuration can be seen in Figure [ADD REF TO FIGURE HERE]. Such a configuration is fabricated using standard rope making manufacturing processes, and as such, allows for a wide variety of potential configurations of parallel STPA elements, structural elements, and heating elements. The isotonic concentric and eccentric actuation performance of these parallel STPA configurations are shown. As part of this study, we present the fabrication techniques for monofilament STPAs and parallel STPAs. We also show how a core can be added to the the parallel configuration in order to for direct heating of the actuator from within the actuator. The stroke-temperature relationship is investigated for both monofilament and parallel actuator designs for three different preload torques.

%	A variety of technologies and materials have been proposed as artificial muscles. Shape-memory alloys (SMA) are a type of ``smart-material'' that can return to a preset shape after some mechanical deformation and thereby act as an actuator. Spun carbon nanotube (CNT) yarns have also been employed as synthetic muscles \cite{lima_electrically, foroughi_torsional} . The expense of SMAs and CNT yarns impede wide scale deployments of the technologies. Conversely, it was recently discovered that extremely inexpensive drawn polymer monofilaments, such as nylon and polyethylene that are used in fishing line, have anisotropic thermal expansion characteristics and can actuate similarly to CNT yarns. By twisting and coiling the fishing line, extremely powerful, lightweight, and inexpensive thermally-activated actuators can be made whose specific load capacity is higher than human muscle \cite{haines_artificial}. %
%	
%	In discussing these actuators, it is important to understand the differences in terminology regarding twist and coiling. A precursor fiber is considered to be a straight drawn polymer fiber, while a twisted fiber is one in which a precursor fiber is twisted about its central axis but remains straight. Although a twisted fiber will remain straight, after twisting its polymer chains will then be helically oriented about the fiber axis with a pitch angle that depends in radial position (see Fig. \ref{fig:helix}). Typically, after twisting the material is annealed so that internal stresses are relieved and the material remains twisted when unloaded. Coiling refers to a fiber, twisted or untwisted, that is annealed in a helical configuration. This helical configuration can be developed by increasing the amount of twist in a precursor fiber to a point at which the fiber torsionally buckles and coils over on itself. Alternatively, a twisted or untwisted fiber can be wrapped around a mandrel prior to annealing. %The thermal annealing process is typically employed to relieve internal stresses so that a twisted or coiled configuration remains when fabrication torques and forces are removed. 
%	Depending on the final configuration of the polymer fiber, a variety of combinations are possible, but the most typical would be twisted-coiled polymer actuators (TCPAs) which provide linear actuation and twisted polymer actuators (TPAs) which provide torsional actuation.

%To date, research on TPAs and TCPAs has focused on experimentally exploring the actuation phenomenon and characterizing actuator performance \cite{haines_artificial, mirvakili_simple, cherubini_experimental, moretti_experimental}. Due in part to the novelty of these devices, the complex geometry of the coiling, and the experimental challenges in model validation, there is limited work on the analytic modeling of these synthetic actuators.  Because of their simpler geometry, the modeling work to date has focused on TPAs rather than TCPAs. 
%Aziz et al. \cite{aziz_controlled} used the thermal expansion properties of twisted fibers along with classical torsion theory to model TPAs and got good agreement with experimental results for both torsional stroke, i.e. untwist, and blocked torque, i.e. torque that develops when the heated fibers are securely clamped.  However, using thermal expansion of the twisted fibers for design purposes can be limiting because it requires experimental tests whenever a new initial twist is inserted.  Additionally, their work assumed no length changes in the twisted fibers.

        \label{fig:coiled}
\end{figure}

\section{Methods for isotonic torsional stroke testing}
In order to characterize these torsional actuators, an experimental setup was designed and built which maintained a constant torque on the actuators during heating. A preload torque is known to be required to bring these actuators back to their initial angle state after cooling. The experimental setup included a 3D printed frame, ball bearing, torque spool, clamp, and weight. This setup can be see in figure \ref{fig:setup}. In this figure, the actuator sample can be seen to be clamped on the right of the frame. The left side of the sample is glued into the torque spool, a hollow pulley that interfaces with a bearing pair. A pair of ball bearings are used to react both the moment and radial loads passed into the torque spool from the weight. This weight hangs from the 6 mm diameter torque by a fine steel wire. 

The position of the weight is measured using a Polytec OVF-5000/OVF-534 vibrometer controller and sensor unit, along with DD-900 Digital Displacement Decoder unit. The voltage output of this system is linearly related to a change of position of the object on which it focuses. This voltage is recorded by a National Instruments PXI-XXXX multifunction data acquisition card, which simultaneously samples temperature measurement from the K-type thermocouple embedded within the test sample as shown in figure \ref{fig:setup}. Ambient room temperature is noted from the sample temperature prior to the application of a thermal load. Temperature and displacement measurements are recorded at 100 Hz. 

Each test is initiate by clamping an actuator sample in a frame and applying a preload torque by attaching a weight to the cable on the torque spool. The laser vibrometer zero position is then reset, and the data acquisition system is started. A hot air source is then placed adjacent to the sample to heat the actuator. When the temperature of the actuator reaches between 90-100$^\circ$C the heat source is removed, as temperatures above 120$^\circ$C are known to anneal the nylon precursor fibers. The actuator is then allowed to cool under free convection until the internal temperature returns to the pre-heating condition. Samples that return to their initial angle after this cooling period are reused in subsequent tests, but those that maintained a non-zero final displacement angle were discarded after testing.
